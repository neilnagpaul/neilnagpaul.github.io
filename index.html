  <h1>Welcome</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm Neil Nagpaul and welcome to my website.</p>
  <p>I am freshman at Grafton High School and my passion is computer science. I enjoy working on various projects,
    especially those involving robotics and artificial intelligence. In my free time, I like to read tech blogs,
    experiment with new programming languages, and participate in coding competitions.</p>
  <p>Outside of computing, I like playing badminton and pickleball, reading, and hanging out with friends.</p>

      <h3>Kind Together</h3>
      <p>
        Kind Together is a project that I am leading to help connect volunteers with people in need. Unfortunately, I
        cannot say much more about until the project is officially launched. Stay tuned!

      <h3>Hands to Words</h3>
      <p>Hands to Words is a science fair project that I am currently working on with a few friends. The goal of the
        project is to create a device that can translate American Sign Language (ASL) into English text. The device uses
        a camera to capture hand gestures and a machine learning model to interpret the gestures. The project is still
        in the early stages of development, but we hope to have a working prototype soon!</p>

      <h3>Garagebot</h3>
      <p>Garagebot was a project that used the myQ API to control a garage door opener to avoid paying steep fees for a
        smart garage door opener. You can read more about it in my <a href="blog/garagebot">blog post</a>.</p>

      <h3>Photo Narrations</h3>
      <p>I built a website from scratch for a local wedding photographer. The website showcases the photographer's work
        and allows users to get in touch. However, the website is no longer live.</p>
